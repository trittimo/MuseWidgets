Expanding-Rectangle Widget
This widget is a simple rectangle that expands on mouseover. It must be placed somewhere
inside of a state button: the first parent state button it encounters will be the button
that gives the element interactivity. For example, if there is a 100x100 pixel state
button that contains a 50x50 state button which in turn contains this widget, the widget
will only expand when you hover over the 50x50 state button.
